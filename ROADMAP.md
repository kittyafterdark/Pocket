# Pocket evaluation backlog — 2026-10-06

Main Lumi is the evaluation environment. Update LumiTest after this pass, not during it.
Preserve messaging/candidate commit behavior; changes below are targeted fixes and presentation work.

## Functional fixes

- [x] Setup: in-phone Run setup / Skip invitation avoids the greeting race; chat lifecycle and resume controls.
- [x] Setup: clear hierarchy, unclipped authorship choices, native connection/model controls.
- [x] Setup controls/hierarchy first pass: theme-aware sections, short authorship labels, native select/model controls, resume action.
- [x] Enrichment: thinking/writing/completion/error feedback; unlock retry without losing edits.
- [x] Generation: current connection/model selection verified by the user across two providers and four models on main Lumi.
- [x] Messages: cancellable generation with stop control.
- [x] Messages: quick manual Here/Away presence assignment.
- [x] Profiles: reusable Pocket Persona and character phone profiles.
- [x] Sidebar: restore hidden launcher; six-device Recent limit, search, single-pass interaction index.
- [x] Sidebar: explicit Show launcher recovery action.
- [x] Mobile fullscreen: convert visual viewport/keyboard offsets to host layout pixels under UI scale; observe scale changes.
- [x] World: setup reseed control, weekly weather outlook and timeline review with proposed event updates.
- [x] Camera: shutter doubles as stop; integrated acceptance.
- [x] Camera: native image pipeline by default, shared checkpoint picker and native settings navigation.
- [x] Swarm: consume published swarm_loras directives, preserve ordered native layers and direct Swarm strengths.
- [x] Gallery: delete Pocket-owned images only, with explicit irreversible-delete confirmation.
- [x] Avatar crop: bake accepted cover framing into a separate square asset; preserve the original photo.

## Presentation and correctness

- [x] Message actions sheet: compact action list replaces the empty/right-stacked layout.

- [x] Remove stale handset 9:16 descriptions (retain valid image aspect options).
- [ ] Remove fixed violet material/atmosphere; neutral incoming bubbles, theme accents and semantic colors.
- [x] Tracker compositions by type: participants/trajectory, state rail, compact vitals, instrumentation.
- [x] Remove duplicate tracker metadata and explain story-triggered versus elapsed-time updates.
- [x] Weather, timeline, camera and Settings first presentation passes.
- [x] Contacts: subtle NPC Bank archive hint; separate portable casts and individual profiles.
- [x] Theme previews use miniature chat UI; visual preset swatches with SVG wallpapers instead of names.
- [x] Associate remaining Settings fields; audit keyboard Space activation and prevent avatar scrolling.
- [x] Appearance: sequential edits preserve theme selection; immediate preview updates, explicit Custom state, OLED presets and bubblegum hearts.
- [x] Contacts library navigation, scaled handset sheets and separate conversation invite cards.
- [x] Narrative clocks use constrained day-part keys; generation supports manual/automatic retry; Timeline updates existing beats automatically.

## Protection and maintenance (after visible UI settles)

- [x] Controlled visual regression matrix: 60 mobile/desktop baselines for home/settings/chat/camera/sidebar/tracker widgets/weather/cards/full phone/connectors and clock precision.
- [x] Expand controlled coverage for handset/UI-scale extremes, long notifications and Appearance palettes.
- [x] Hostile global-theme fixture verifies Shadow DOM isolation and visual stability.
- [x] Separate inline styling from handset/app styling; activity ShadowRoots only receive inline styles.
- [ ] Further shared-token/reset cleanup after the remaining design work.
- [x] Initial controller/backend extraction: app reviews and progress controls.
- [ ] Continue gradual orchestration extraction with unchanged behavior and regression coverage.
- [x] Supplied tracker and weather widget passes integrated; compact handset layouts, condition artwork and forecast capsules.
- [x] Live desktop/mobile connector and clock fallback checks: completed by the user on main Lumi.
- [ ] Catch LumiTest up after main Lumi evaluation.

Verification claims must distinguish unit/contracts, controlled browser fixtures, real provider calls,
and live main Lumi checks. Do not use personal chat data as test fixtures or modify it for convenience.
